# Opening UIF files on Mac

You've got a UIF file from a friend and have no clue how to use it on your
Mac? No need to go and boot up your old Windows PC (if you still have one).
Just drop the file into UIF2ISO for Mac and it will convert it into a standard
ISO format. The ISO you can just use with OSX. Open it. Burn it. It's really
that simple.

No command line knowledge required. In finder just drag your file on to the
program icon or open it from the file menu. It will convert your file at a
snap.
